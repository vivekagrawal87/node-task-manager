# Task Manager Application

This is task manager Rest application I have worked on during Nodejs training. This application publishes Rest APIs for task management. While working on it, I have got exposure to:
1. Rest API development using Express and Nodejs
2. Testing Nodejs application using Jest
3. Connecting Nodejs to mongodb using mongoose
4. Authenticating Nodejs using JWT
